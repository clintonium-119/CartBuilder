<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Inspired by the card game created by <a href="https://www.badgersfrommars.com" target="_new">Badgers From Mars</a>
</p><p>
A sinister corruption has spread throughout the four great kingdoms, blackening the hearts of once-loved Kings and Queens and those that protect them. As brave adventurers you must work together using the special powers of your champions and animal companions. Overthrow the corrupted monarchs, purge them of their darkness and add them to your ranks so that life can be brought to the land once more.
</p><p>
Recruit heroes, storm the castle and defeat the corrupted Monarchy! In Regicide players must work together and use the unique powers of each suit to achieve victory!
</p><p>
You can buy an original set of cards from their shop <a href="https://www.badgersfrommars.com/buy-regicide" target="_new">here</a>.
</p><p>
The graphics for our game were adapted from the artwork of the original game. However, the actual game has a complete set of beautifully prepared cards and are worth the buying for that alone.

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>
<p>
This game consists of a POP file and supporting sound assets packaged in a .zip file. Please expand the contents into a directory on you computer - you will see a POP file and a sub-directory called music. Please ensure both the .POP file and folder are copied to the root directory of your SD card.
</p><p>
Depending on what other games are installed on your Pokitto, you may already have a sub-directory called /music on your machine. If prompted, simply merge the contents of the Regicide directory with the folder already on your machine. The names of the file are unique and should not clash!
