<p>
Inspired by the Atari 2600 game Enduro.
</p><p>
Strap on your goggles. Sink into your seat. And leave all your fears in the pit. You’re about to enter the race of your life. You’ll be required to pass lots of cars each day. From sunrise to sunset - as fast as you can. Welcome to the National Enduro!
</p><p>

With each passing day, your target number of cars will increase. For an extra challenge, switch to a manual transmission!
</p>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>
This game consists of a POP file and supporting sound assets packaged in a .zip file. Please expand the contents into a directory on you computer - you will see a POP file and a sub-directory called music. Please ensure both the .POP file and folder are copied to the root directory of your SD card.
</p><p>
Depending on what other games are installed on your Pokitto, you may already have a sub-directory called /music on your machine. If prompted, simply merge the contents of the RoadTrip directory with the folder already on your machine. The names of the file are unique and should not clash!

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>
This game features a custom sound track by <a href="https://talk.pokitto.com/u/gibs/summary" target="_new">gibs</a>. It is excellent and really adds to the game! While driving the car, press the <b>C button</b> to reveal the radio and flip between the different tracks he has added.

<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>
Our good friend @retr0rob has reviewed the game side-by-side with the original Arduboy version.  The Pokitto version sure has come a long way from the original version.
