<p>
Over the last few months, I have made a version of one of my favourite childhood games - Karateka!
</p><p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>
Karateka is a 1984 martial arts action game by Jordan Mechner, and was his first published game, created while attending Yale University. It was originally programmed for the Apple II, then widely ported.
</p><p>
The player controls an unnamed protagonist who is attempting to rescue his love interest, the Princess Mariko, from Akuma’s castle fortress. The game exhibits a combination of a side-scrolling platform and fighting game elements similar to a beat 'em up. The player uses punches and kicks to defeat Akuma and his guards and make his way deeper into the fortress.
</p>

<h2>About this Beta</h2>
<p>
Although not quite finished, I have released this version to solicit feedback and suggestions. Currently the game is consuming nearly all of the available memory so the changes will need to be prioritised on merit and size.
</p>

<h2>Scenes</h2>
<p>
The following screenshots show some of the scenes from the game. Fight the various soldiers, avoid the Akuma’s eagle and save Mariko.
